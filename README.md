## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Frontend Mentor always has good challenge designs to build, this was also another good design challenge for me. Key takeaways for this challenge:
- HTML Markup structure **critical**
- I attempted the challenge using Flexbox - I believe the challenge would have been more fun to produce using Grid as this would've helped design the HTML structure in a much cleaner manner.
- As a Frontend developer one needs to be able to pay close attention to the details of the design spec provided and do absolute best to re-produce the same design.

**My approach**
- Build the mock-up with the mobile-design approach.
- Markout sections on the design that will be broken down into my HTML Markup
- Setup basic styles to be used for my typography.

**My challenges**
- Designing the challenge to the spec that was provided.

**Final takeaway**
- Definitely more practice in doing the challenges to get a good hang of building the designs.
- I'm happy on the outcome - there is always room for improvement and I undertake to check other peoples solutions and see how they approached doing this challenge.

### Continued development

- Accessibility
- Media queries
- GRID
- Flexbox 
- CSS Properties: vw, vh etc.
